# Machine Learning Models with Python

This repository contains Python scripts implementing various machine learning algorithms using the `scikit-learn` library. The scripts include code for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation of different machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and k-means clustering.

## Project Overview

This repository provides example implementations of common machine learning algorithms used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The code is written in Python and uses `scikit-learn` for implementing and training the models.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The implementation includes:

- Reading a dataset from a CSV file.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a linear regression model.
- Making predictions on the test set.
- Visualizing the training and test results.

### Multiple Linear Regression

**Multiple Linear Regression** extends linear regression by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. The implementation includes:

- Reading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Encoding categorical data using `OneHotEncoder`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a multiple linear regression model.
- Making predictions on the test set.
- Concatenating and comparing the predicted and actual results.

### Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression** is used for binary classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. The implementation includes:

- Reading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a logistic regression model.
- Making predictions on the test set.
- Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Support Vector Machine** is used for classification tasks by finding a hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. The implementation includes:

- Reading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training an SVM model with a linear kernel.
- Making predictions on the test set.
- Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

### K-Means Clustering

**K-Means Clustering** is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into clusters. The implementation includes:

- Reading the dataset and selecting features for clustering.
- Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Training the K-Means model.
- Visualizing the clusters with different colors.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Required Libraries

The required Python libraries can be installed using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash

## Running the Code

Each machine learning model is implemented in a separate script. You can run the scripts as follows:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   ```bash
   python multiple_linear_regression.py
   ```

3. **Logistic Regression**:
   ```bash
   python logistic_regression.py
   ```

4. **Support Vector Machine**:
   ```bash
   python svm.py
   ```

5. **K-Means Clustering**:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```

Make sure to replace `"Filename.csv"` with the path to your dataset in each script.
